## Introduction

Pokio simplifies the process of building asynchronous applications in PHP. It is designed for developers who want to leverage the power of asynchronous programming without diving deep into complex frameworks or libraries. Whether you're building a web application, a microservice, or a background task handler, Pokio provides the tools you need to manage concurrent operations effectively.

## Features

- **Simplicity**: Easy to set up and use.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead for faster performance.
- **Asynchronous**: Handle multiple tasks simultaneously.
- **Compatibility**: Works with existing PHP codebases.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples.

## Installation

To install Pokio, you can use Composer. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer require saispl12/pokio
```

Ensure you have Composer installed on your system. If you don't have it yet, visit [getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org/) for installation instructions.

## Usage

Using Pokio is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a basic example to get you started:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Pokio\Pokio;

$api = new Pokio();

$api->addTask(function() {
    // Your asynchronous task here
    return "Task 1 completed";
});

$api->addTask(function() {
    // Another asynchronous task
    return "Task 2 completed";
});

$results = $api->execute();
print_r($results);
```

This code sets up a simple asynchronous task manager. You can add multiple tasks and execute them concurrently, collecting the results as they complete.

## Examples

### Example 1: Fetching Data Asynchronously

You can use Pokio to fetch data from multiple APIs simultaneously. Hereâ€™s how:

```php
$api->addTask(function() {
    return file_get_contents('https://api.example.com/data1');
});

$api->addTask(function() {
    return file_get_contents('https://api.example.com/data2');
});

$results = $api->execute();
print_r($results);
```

### Example 2: Running Background Jobs

Pokio can also manage background jobs effectively. Hereâ€™s an example of running a long-running task:

```php
$api->addTask(function() {
    sleep(5); // Simulating a long task
    return "Long task completed";
});

$results = $api->execute();
print_r($results);
```
